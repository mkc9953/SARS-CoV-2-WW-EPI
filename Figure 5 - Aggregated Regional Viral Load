# The intent of this simple figure is to give an approximation of the population-normalized viral load for entire region
# being serviced by the 9 wastewater treatment facilities sampled for this study.
# This is accomplished by determining total viral load for a sample date (sum of (concentration * flow) for each of the 9 WWTP's) divided
# by the population of the region.
# The goal here is to create a rough estimate so that trends can be observed (e.g. increasing load during the onset of an epidemic, 
# decreasing load after social interventions are applied).


# The data for this file included the columns; "Date" and "Load", where aggregated load has already been calculated as described above.
