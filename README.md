# SARS-CoV-2-WW-EPI


This repository contains the code for five figures used to visualize SARS-CoV-2 clinical cases and RNA detection in wastewater.  The figures are used in a paper that is currently (as of 6/12) submitted to Water Research. 

Figure 1 depicts clinically confirmed cases and pulls data from a NY Times repo here -- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/master/us-counties.csv

The remaining 4 figures are created using data generated by HRSD and represent concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in wastewater, enumerated using the 3 CDC assays (N1, N2, N3).  

Concentration is converted to population normalized viral load in order to compare trends between WWTP catchments.

    population normalized viral load = (CoV-2 concentration in raw wastewater * wastewater flow at sample time) / catchment population
